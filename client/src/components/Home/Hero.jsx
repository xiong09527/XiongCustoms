            Dive into the heritage of the Xiong Clan!

          <p className="my-5">
            As generation passes, the younger generation comes to take our place
            as we have taken our fathers place in the past. The youngsters have
            experienced the unique journey of growing up in the United States
            and becoming Americanized and adjusting to the American culture. We
            find ourselves at a crossroad where traditions and practices of our
            elders are slowly fading away, as fewer and fewer individuals take
            the time to study and learn them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our culture heritage encompasses a myriad of traditions from wedding
            ceremonies, funeral rituals, and even the subtle thank-you rites to
            our man and woman shamans. These customs, passed down through
            generations, hold a profound significance in our community, serving
            as the pillars that uphold our identity and values.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            As Western Civilization continues to influence our lives, there is a
            need to safeguard these traditions from being lost to time. By
            delving into the heritage of the Xiong Clan, one of the 18 clans of
            the Hmong people, we not only honor the legacy of our ancestors but
            also gain a deeper understand of who we are and where we come from.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Join us on this journey of exploration and rediscover as we
            celebrate the richness of our culture heritage and strive to
            preserve it for generations to come!!
